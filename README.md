Welcome to Polymer Starter Kit Light!

To begin, fire up a local server from inside the `app` directory. Please make sure to serve up the contents of the directory rather than root as routing will otherwise fail to correctly function.

## Setup
1. Download Polymer Starter Kit Light from https://github.com/polymerelements/polymer-starter-kit/releases
2. Extract the contents into this directory.

## Firing up a server using Go

```
go run main.go
```
